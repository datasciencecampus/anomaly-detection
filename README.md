Anomaly detection in the age of deep learning

Background:
Anomalies can be broadly identified as patterns in datasets that do not 
follow a well-defined trend of normal behaviour, and the goal of anomaly
detection is to detect all such behaviour if possible. Anomalies can arise
out of errors in the data collection process but sometimes, and somewhat
more interestingly, can be  indicative of a new, previously unknown,
underlying process. Anomaly detection is a burgeoning research field
and has a diverse range of applications including fraud detection,
health care monitoring, fault detection in machines to name a few.


Problem:
With the advancements in machine learning techniques and proliferation
in computing power in recent years, deep learning has specifically gained
widespread attention as a testbed to learn intricate underlying representation
of often complex real world datasets.The current project thus aims to compare
the performance of deep learning based anomaly detection methods with more
traditional approaches for anomaly detection  such as k-means, Isolation
Forests and SVM. This comparison is particularly important for large scale
datasets where performance of traditional models is expected to be less than
optimal as it would be difficult for these models to capture complex structure of multidimensional real world datasets. 


Action: 
The project will begin with a brief literature review of the field, with a special
focus on identifying relevant data sources and narrowing down the most relevant deep
learning models suited for the model. The project will mainly focus on investigating
Unsupervised deep anomaly detection methods, if a suitable data source with labelled
dataset is identified then Semi-supervised and Supervised deep anomaly detection methods
can be investigated as well. Various methods can be explored under deep learning based
anomaly detection including Generative models and Deep Belief Networks.
